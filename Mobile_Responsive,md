# Mobile Responsive Component

## Rules
- **Never change desktop layout** — all edits must be inside mobile breakpoints only (`sm:` and below, or before `md:`)
- Use `md:` as the breakpoint boundary — everything before it is mobile, everything at `md:` and above preserves the current design
- Do not remove or rename any existing Tailwind classes — only prepend mobile variants or add new mobile-first classes alongside them
- Fixed widths (e.g. `w-[1440px]`) should become `w-full` on mobile with `md:w-[1440px]`
- Horizontal layouts (`flex-row`, `grid-cols-N`) should stack on mobile: `flex-col md:flex-row`
- Overflow or clipped content on mobile: reduce padding, font size, or gap using mobile prefix classes
- Hidden elements on mobile use `hidden md:block` — visible-only-mobile use `block md:hidden`
- Font sizes and spacing: scale down with mobile classes, keep original value at `md:`

## Approach
1. View the component at mobile width and identify what breaks or overflows
2. Add mobile-prefixed classes to fix each issue — do not touch the unprefixed (desktop) classes
3. Test that desktop view is pixel-identical before and after
